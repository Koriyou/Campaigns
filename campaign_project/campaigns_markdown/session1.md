# Session 1 Notes 
## Date: 26/12/2023

- The session commenced with Teddy bidding farewell to the village of Bearne. Before his departure, he received several parting gifts from the villagers:
	- Grigor
	- Alaric
	- Isolde
	- Lyra
- Teddy’s journey is taking him to the port town of Verena, which is expected to be a 10.5-day journey.
	- Presently, he finds himself four days into his voyage when an extraordinary event occurred:
		- On the third day of his journey, an unusual flower descended from the sky. This peculiar flower has the remarkable ability to grow when nourished and is composed of an otherworldly metal. Astonishingly, the flower fused itself with Teddy’s hand, turning it into a golden appendage.
		- This enigmatic flower, which goes by the name Christa, possesses knowledge related to alchemy and transmutation. It has made a promise to educate Teddy in these arcane arts if he assists her in achieving a transformation of her own.
